KNOWN BUGS-----------------------------
---------------------------------------
Exporting all Tilesets will cause SMASM to go unresponsive 
	-Need to set this up as a backgroundworker...


The FX data got messed up for a couple rooms i was working on a while back.
	-Could not reproduce.
	-It filled the FX list with a bunch of garbage data up to like 10 entries.


TTB export turned all the files into 0's for some reason
	-Could not reproduce.
	-Export TTBs only is kinda obsolete since we have Singleset now. Could remove and not worry about it?


---------------------------------------
FEATURES TODO-----------------------
---------------------------------------
GENERAL FUNCTIONALITY
Repointing for scroll PLM data...
	-would have to build a scroll PLM editor into SMASM just like all the other state specific data.

Make the config file remember the setting for level buffer freespace


MDB List to ASM

Need to update the ASM template that it generates.


MDB to Map Generator
	-could read from ROM, or from the hack ASM file?
	-Read from ASM would probably be faster, but read from ROM would be faster for the user to set up.


PLM/ENEMY SELECTOR
Support for tagged searching
	-pull images from SMILE folder.


TILESET I/O
Have it update the ASM file with the tileset table address specified in the SMASM config file.


ROOM I/O
Export singular rooms to independent ASM files.
	-Copy entire source ASM file; strip out all the SMASM stuff and then re-add the target room.
	-Doesn't necessarily need to load a Room object from the ASM file; it only needs to know the label and get rid of everything else in the SMASM space.

Import rooms from one ASM file to another.
	-Again, it doesn't need to load the room as an object; just move the text around.
