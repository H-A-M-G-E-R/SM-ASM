KNOWN BUGS-----------------------------
---------------------------------------
Exporting all Tilesets will cause SMASM to go unresponsive 
	-Need to set this up as a backgroundworker...

There might still be some bugs with state reordering? Need to investigate.


The FX data got messed up for a couple rooms i was working on a while back.
	-Could not reproduce.
	-It filled the FX list with a bunch of garbage data up to like 10 entries.


TTB export turned all the files into 0's for some reason
	-Could not reproduce.
	-Export TTBs only is kinda obsolete since we have Singleset now. Could remove and not worry about it?
